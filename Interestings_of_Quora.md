##Why do American people not care about the Japanese Prime Minister's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine?

####Possible explanations (each of which may or may not be a caricature of reality):
####可能的解释（它们可能是现实的夸张）：
* Americans generally respect soldiers very highly and don't think much of war crimes (especially their own).
* 普遍地，美国人非常尊重士兵，不会想太多有关战争的罪行（特别是它们自己的）
* Christianity doesn't do ancestor-worship, so Americans don't really understand the significance of war criminals being "enshrined" at Yasukuni.
* 基督教没有祖先崇拜，因此美国人并不真正了解的战犯被“供奉”在靖国神社的意义。
* Chinese people only care so strongly about this issue because their media keeps directing attention to it in and away from domestic problems.
* 中国人这么强烈地关心这个问题，因为他们的媒体一直将注意力集中到它，并且很少提及国内问题。

* Americans generally don't know or care much what happens in other countries.
*美国人一般不知道也不关心其他国家发生的事情。


##What can I do while I'm earning a CS degree to develop real world programming skills?

1. **Competitive Coding: Infinite youth :D**
One of the top secrets to staying young forever :D
 Practice on codechef, topcoder etc. Read other top coders code. Sometimes it'll just make you wonder, how beautifully "Out of the box" people can think! 


2. **Moonlight Project:**
Work on a secret project with a friend or two. Have big goals and plans for it. Keep working on it whenever your bored. Who knows this might be "THE NEXT BIG THING"  and if not you have your lessons to learn from for the next big thing that happens. 


3. **Clean coding:**
Most Ignored feature during student life, hits you hard when you join workplace if you write dirty  un-organized code. 
Something I personally faced when I started my job! 
Read books like:
The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master.
Clean Coding.


4. **Develop Design Skills:**
Design is a very important part of coding. A well designed code can save you 10 fold the time and energy to debug later. So read up books like Design Patterns by Head First etc, to start thinking well in design direction. 


5. **Use control Version System:**
Torvald's didn't build it, for no reason :D
Use git for your projects, that way you will also be learning how to use git as well as maintain all of your code at one place. 


6. **Think of Test Cases for your code:**
Think of boundary cases, think of various inputs that could be issued to your code. This way, you ll develop the habit of developing products that handles a lot of test cases. 


7. **Find the editor to pledge for:**
This is the time to explore the geeky side of editors like vi,emacs etc. They have a lot of tweaks and tricks that make it very fast to use for coding. This will take you long as a coder, and during school days it s so much fun to explore these options. 

8. **Just Automate it : Be a Boss of Scripting**
Don't be a robot, just create one! 
Learn bash scripting, automate all the things you manually do, for instance once you switch on your laptop,
    (i) Open Browser
    (ii) Switch on VLC
    (iii) Open terminal window etc etc
Automate the entire process with a script. Learn how to run cron jobs. 


9. **UPDATE mylife SET energy = infinity WHERE User = "Me" ;** 
Take part on whatever forums interest you, like Stack Overflow, Quora etc. Further, attend meet ups in the fields your interested in. Super interesting ted talks are available watch them. This will all keep you motivated and going. It also assures your heading in the right direction. Take part in overnight hackathons. Nightout hackathons are real fun! You'll explore a part of you that can code anything overnight :D Confidence booster.


10. **sudo apt-get update me**
Your a budding engineer, stay updated with latest tech news so that you know where your interests spur and which direction to traverse. This way your brain will also trigger new ideas, who knows you might be the next kid working in the garage :D


11. **Open Source:**
Contribute to open source projects, that way you ll learn how big projects work, how good coders contribute. 

12. **Dig Deeper dont settle at concepts:**
Just like goldminer game, keep mining, never settle at one level.
When you learn new concepts in school, look up the applications of it. You'll be amazed to see where and all its used. For example how Spanning tree protocol is used in network switches to avoid loops, totally impressed me when i was studying spanning trees. Try and find out what concepts drive your favorite app. 

13. **The beauty of Symmetry:**
Practice symmetry in coding from now! It'll be ingrained into the atoms that make you, thereby turning your future code to be potentially bug free. By symetry I mean, when you write malloc write the free statement immediately after a few lines. Same goes for file handlers etc. You can save yourself from a lot of leaks that could come up.

14. **Additional Development Tools:**
Learn valgrind, calgrind, make, gprof utilities which makes life so much easier. Learn Bash commands. They come in handy when you are in real need. 

P.S. Remember this is the time to explore! Explore as much as you can.
